**Mongu** is yet another Python Object-Document Mapper on top of ``PyMongo``. It's lightweight, intuitive to use and easy to understand.

- If you want **control**.
- If you really care about **performance**.
- If those **heavy and slow layers** have nothing or more than you need.

Well, **Mongu** maybe the one for you.

You are the only one who knows what you reall need.

Therefor **Mongu** does nothing but a skeleton for you to fill.

Actually, if you have ever tried to write your own ODM, you may already implemented parts of **Mongu** :D
